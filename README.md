### About

This blog app will allow you to sign in by creating an account using the following: username and password.
The password you use will be hashed using the Werkzeug library, so your account becomes more secure.
Once you have created your account, you can make use of the login form by entering your credentials into the form.
Once signed in, you will be redirected to the main page, where you will be able to see all of the posts made by the other users ordered by date created.
Every post has like/dislike functionality for you to use and show support for the posts.
In the profile section, you can see the log-out function for you to end your session and also see a list of all the posts you have made, giving you the opportunity to delete them by clicking on the "Delete" button.
By clicking on a single post title, you will be redirected to another screen where you can see the post by itself.
